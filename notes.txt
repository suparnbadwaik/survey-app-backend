## Deploy app on Heroku - Checklist
1. Dynamic port :
Heroku tells us which port our app will use. so we need to make sure that we listen to the port it tells us to.
Refer line 8 for this where PORT is assigned dynamically
2. Specify Node environment :
We need to tell Heroklu which node version to use. 
So Specify node engine viz node an npm version in package.json file.
3. Specify start script :
Instruct heroku what command to run to start our server running.
Set the start script in package.json file.
4. Create .gitignore file :
We must not push dependencies, Heroku will do that for us.
